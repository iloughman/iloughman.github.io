    A Drinking Song </br>
    By William Butler Yeats
  </p>
  <p>
    Wine comes in at the mouth </br>
    And love comes in at the eye; </br>
    Thatâ€™s all we shall know for truth </br>
    Before we grow old and die. </br>
    I lift the glass to my mouth, </br>
    I look at you, and I sigh. </br>
